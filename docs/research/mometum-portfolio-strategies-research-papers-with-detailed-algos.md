# Momentum Portfolio Strategies: Research Papers with Detailed Algorithms

The most valuable momentum research spans from foundational academic work establishing the phenomenon through modern ETF-specific implementations, with complete algorithmic specifications enabling practical deployment across global markets. **Seven major paper categories provide reproducible methodologies**: foundational cross-sectional momentum, time-series trend-following, dual momentum frameworks, ETF rotation strategies, global multi-asset approaches, sector-based implementations, and risk-managed variations. These strategies collectively demonstrate 30+ years of validated performance across stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and ETFs, with Sharpe ratios ranging from 0.70 to 1.79 and systematic crash protection through absolute momentum filters.

## Foundational academic research with complete specifications

The seminal academic papers established momentum as one of finance's most robust anomalies while providing precise implementation algorithms. **Jegadeesh and Titman's 1993 Journal of Finance paper** "Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers" created the canonical cross-sectional momentum framework still used today. Their exact algorithm: rank all NYSE/AMEX stocks by past J-month returns (J = 3, 6, 9, or 12 months), form 10 equal-weighted decile portfolios, buy the top decile and sell the bottom decile, hold for K months (K = 3, 6, 9, or 12), and use overlapping portfolios with monthly rebalancing. **The most examined 6-month/6-month strategy generated 0.95% monthly returns** (t-stat = 3.07) from 1965-1989, approximately 12% annually before costs. Critically, they skip the most recent month to avoid short-term reversal effects and bid-ask bounce. Their 2001 follow-up paper validated continued profitability through 1997, generating 1.01% monthly returns out-of-sample, conclusively refuting data-mining concerns.

**Carhart's 1997 four-factor model** added momentum as the fourth factor (UMD/WML) to Fama-French, constructing it via: sort all stocks by past 11 months of returns (skipping month t-1), form deciles, create an equal-weighted portfolio of the top 30% minus bottom 30%, rebalance monthly. This UMD factor is freely available on Kenneth French's data library and forms the foundation for countless applications. Carhart's framework enables performance attribution separating momentum exposure from market, size, and value factors.

**Rouwenhorst's 1998 international extension** proved momentum exists across 12 European countries using quintile portfolios with 6-month formation and 6-month holding periods. His internationally diversified winner portfolio outperformed losers by over 1% monthly from 1980-1995, with 0.43 correlation to U.S. momentum. This cross-border validation demonstrated momentum as a global phenomenon rather than U.S.-specific data artifact.

The most comprehensive academic validation came from **Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen's 2013 Journal of Finance paper "Value and Momentum Everywhere."** They documented momentum across eight diverse asset classes: U.S. stocks, U.K. stocks, European stocks, Japanese stocks, country equity indices, currencies, government bonds, and commodities. Their uniform momentum calculation: MOM2-12 = cumulative return from months t-2 to t-12 (skipping most recent month), applied identically across all markets. Portfolio construction used rank-weighted positioning where weight equals c_t × (rank(signal) - average_rank), scaled to $1 long and $1 short. **Global stock momentum achieved a 0.59 Sharpe ratio, while combining all asset classes reached 0.74**. Most critically, they discovered value and momentum exhibit -0.60 correlation globally, such that a 50/50 value-momentum combination achieves a 1.59 Sharpe ratio—far superior to either factor alone while being immune to liquidity risk that affects each separately.

## Time-series momentum with implementable algorithms

Time-series momentum (trend-following) uses each asset's own past return rather than relative ranking. **Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen's seminal 2012 Journal of Financial Economics paper** provided the complete algorithmic specification for 58 liquid global instruments (24 commodity futures, 12 currency forwards, 9 equity index futures, 13 government bond futures). Their exact signal: sign(r^s_{t-12,t}) where r^s_{t-12,t} is the past 12-month excess return. Position sizing incorporates volatility scaling: each position = sign(return) × (40%/σ) × base exposure, where σ is exponentially weighted volatility with 60-day center of mass calculated as (σ^s_t)² = 261 × Σ(1-δ)δ^i(r^s_{t-1-i} - r̄^s_t)² with δ ≈ 0.9836. The diversified strategy equal-weights all instruments and targets 10% portfolio volatility. **This achieved a 1.10 Sharpe ratio from 1985-2009 with 1.58% monthly alpha** (t-stat = 7.99) versus traditional factors, performing especially well during market stress.

**Hurst, Ooi, and Pedersen's 2013 refinement** combined three trend horizons: 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month lookbacks using identical volatility scaling. Each horizon generates its own signal, and the diversified strategy equal-weights across all horizons and instruments. Performance by horizon (1985-2012): 1-month Sharpe 1.26, 3-month Sharpe 1.43, 12-month Sharpe 1.52, and combined diversified Sharpe **1.79 with 19.4% annual returns**. Their 2017 extension validated this approach across 137 years (1880-2016), showing positive returns in every decade and profitable performance in 8 of the 10 largest historical crises. Weekly rebalancing proved nearly as effective as daily with far lower costs.

**Gary Antonacci's absolute momentum** provides the simplest trend-following algorithm: calculate 12-month total return for an asset, compare to Treasury bill return, invest if asset return exceeds T-bills, otherwise move to bonds or cash. Testing from 1974-2012 showed every asset examined (equities, bonds, REITs, commodities, gold) achieved higher Sharpe ratios and 30-70% lower drawdowns when combined with absolute momentum versus buy-and-hold. The mechanism works as a systematic crash protection filter, exiting positions when trends turn negative.

## Dual momentum combining relative and absolute signals

**Antonacci's dual momentum framework** synthesizes cross-sectional and time-series approaches into a two-stage process. Stage 1 (relative momentum): calculate 12-month total returns for two competing assets, select the higher performer. Stage 2 (absolute momentum): if the winner's return exceeds T-bills, invest 100% in the winner; otherwise move to bonds. **His Global Equity Momentum (GEM) strategy** applies this to just three ETFs: SPY (U.S. stocks), VEU (international stocks), and AGG (bonds). Monthly rebalancing of this dead-simple strategy generated 17.4% annual returns with 13.2% volatility and 1.02 Sharpe ratio from 1974-2015, versus 10.4% returns and 0.51 Sharpe for a static 60/40 portfolio. Maximum drawdown was just -18.6% versus -44.6% for buy-and-hold, avoiding major bear markets by exiting to bonds in December 2007.

Antonacci's **four-module expanded framework** applies dual momentum to different risk categories: (1) equity risk with U.S. versus EAFE stocks, (2) credit risk with high yield versus investment grade bonds, (3) real estate with equity REITs versus mortgage REITs, and (4) economic stress with gold versus long Treasuries. Each 20% module independently applies dual momentum with T-bills as absolute momentum reference. The composite equal-weighted strategy achieved 14.9% returns with just 8.0% volatility and **1.07 Sharpe ratio with only -10.9% maximum drawdown** from 1974-2011. Average invested exposure remained around 70%, automatically reducing risk during unfavorable periods.

The power of combining both momentum types becomes clear in Antonacci's decomposition: relative momentum alone (picking winners) achieved 13.5% returns with -54.6% maximum drawdown; absolute momentum alone (trend following) achieved 12.0% returns with -29.4% drawdown; **dual momentum combining both achieved 15.8% returns with only -23.0% drawdown**—superior returns with significantly less risk.

## ETF-specific momentum strategies with complete implementation details

**Meb Faber's 2007 "Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation"** (the most downloaded paper on SSRN) provides the standard ETF momentum implementation. His algorithm: for each of 5 ETFs (SPY, EFA, VNQ, DBC, IEF), calculate the 10-month simple moving average; on the last trading day of each month, allocate 20% to any ETF trading above its SMA and move that 20% to intermediate Treasuries (IEF) for any below. The 5-asset strategy achieved 10.2% returns with 7.0% volatility and 0.70 Sharpe from 1973-2012, compared to 9.7% returns with 10.1% volatility for static buy-and-hold. **Most importantly, maximum drawdown was just -11% versus -32% for passive allocation**, avoiding major bear markets. Extensions to 13 assets (adding small caps, emerging markets, corporate bonds, high yield, TIPS, gold, international REITs) improved the Sharpe to 0.90 with -11% maximum drawdown.

Faber's **aggressive rotation variant** adds ranking: calculate average momentum using 1, 3, 6, and 12-month returns for all 13 ETFs, select the top 3, hold only those above their 10-month SMA, otherwise move to bonds. This generated 13.2% returns with 11.1% volatility (0.75 Sharpe) and -19% drawdown from 1981-2012, adding approximately 3% annual return versus the basic approach.

**Simple Asset Class ETF Momentum (SACEMS)** tracked by CXO Advisory uses 9 diverse ETFs: SPY, EFA, EEM, VNQ, DBC, GLD, AGG, LQD, IEF. The algorithm: calculate 6-month total returns for all nine, rank highest to lowest, select top 1/2/3, equal-weight selections, rebalance monthly. Three variants show the diversification tradeoff: top 1 ETF achieved 11.8% CAGR with 17.1% volatility (0.69 Sharpe, -27.5% drawdown); equal-weight top 3 achieved 10.9% CAGR with 12.8% volatility (**0.85 Sharpe, -20.4% drawdown**) from 2006-2025, vastly outperforming the 6.8% return and -35.7% drawdown of equal-weight buy-and-hold.

The **12-1 month momentum strategy** refines the formation period: calculate 12-month returns, filter out any ETF with return below T-bills (absolute momentum), calculate 1-month returns for survivors, compute momentum score = (12-month return) - (1-month return), rank by score and select top 3-5 ensuring diversification (maximum one ETF per country/sector). This subtracts recent returns to avoid false signals from short-term spikes. Quarterly or semi-annual rebalancing reduces turnover while maintaining effectiveness. Risk management includes 10-15% trailing stops and monitoring high-yield credit spreads (reducing exposure at 400bp, exiting at 700bp).

**Sector rotation momentum** applies to the 11 SPDR sector ETFs (XLK, XLV, XLF, XLE, XLI, XLP, XLY, XLU, XLB, XLRE, XLC). One implementation: start with all sectors, remove any below 9-month SMA, calculate 6-12 month momentum for survivors, rank and select top 5, equal-weight at 20% each. If fewer than 5 pass, fill remainder with Treasury ETF. Quarterly rebalancing (February, May, August, November) keeps turnover manageable. Typical performance shows 10-12% annual returns with -20% to -30% drawdowns, working particularly well in trending markets as a tactical overlay.

More sophisticated approaches include **CTA momentum proxy using ETFs**: 13 ETFs spanning stocks (SPY, IWM, EFA, EEM, IYR, QQQ), bonds (LQD, IEF, TIP), commodities (GLD, USO, DBC), and currency (FXE). Calculate average momentum across 3, 6, 9, and 12-month horizons, inverse volatility weight within asset classes using 20-day historical volatility, apply long positions to stocks and long-short to bonds/commodities/currencies based on positive or negative signals. With 2:1 leverage, this replicates CTA hedge fund strategies at lower cost.

The **correlation filter enhancement** adds regime detection: calculate short-term (20-day) and long-term (250-day) rolling correlations across the ETF universe, compute ratio = 20-day correlation / 250-day correlation. Always hold top 4 ETFs by momentum (25% each, 100% long), but selectively short the worst ETF at 30% weight only when short-term correlation exceeds long-term correlation (indicating trending markets where shorts work). This 130/30 approach with selective shorting based on market regime significantly improves risk-adjusted returns versus naive long-short or long-only.

**Modular dual momentum for 5 asset classes** allocates 20% each to U.S. equities (SPY), Treasury bonds (IEF), REITs (VNQ), corporate bonds (LQD), and gold (GLD). Each asset independently applies absolute momentum: if 12-month return exceeds T-bills, hold the 20% allocation; otherwise move that 20% to aggregate bonds (AGG). This generates 9-11% annual returns with low drawdowns as each module independently adjusts risk exposure.

## Global multi-asset allocation strategies

Academic research demonstrates momentum works across international equity markets. Rouwenhorst's methodology for international momentum: rank stocks within each country by past returns, form winner and loser portfolios (terciles or quintiles), equal-weight within portfolios, create global portfolios across countries. Testing across 12 European markets from 1980-1995 showed internationally diversified winners outperformed losers by over 1% monthly. The 0.43 correlation between U.S. and European momentum suggests shared global momentum factor while still providing diversification benefits.

**Global tactical asset allocation** extends to all liquid markets. Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen's framework equal-weights across U.S., U.K., European, and Japanese stocks using consistent 12-month momentum (skipping last month) with rank-weighted portfolios. Global stock momentum achieved 0.59 Sharpe, but critically, adding country equity indices (0.63 Sharpe), currencies (0.32 Sharpe), bonds (0.17 Sharpe), and commodities (0.51 Sharpe) with equal volatility weighting across asset classes boosted combined Sharpe to **0.74 for momentum everywhere and 1.59 for 50/50 value-momentum combination**. Each asset class momentum showed 0.37-0.65 correlation with others, providing substantial diversification.

For ETF implementation across global markets, investors can use: SPY/IWM (U.S. large/small), EFA/VGK/EWJ (developed international by region), EEM/VWO (emerging markets), regional country ETFs (EWU, EWG, EWZ, EWY, etc.), fixed income (TLT, IEF, SHY, BWX for international bonds), commodity sector ETFs (GLD, SLV, DBC, GSG, USO), currency ETFs (FXE, FXY, FXA, FXC), and broad multi-asset (VT for global stocks, AGG/BND for bonds). The 13-asset GTAA framework using this global diversification showed 11.7% returns with 7.2% volatility and 0.90 Sharpe with just -11% maximum drawdown.

## Selection and ranking algorithms in detail

The most common momentum ranking algorithms follow these patterns. **Standard cross-sectional approach**: for N securities at time t, calculate momentum_i = cumulative_return(t-12, t-1) skipping most recent month, rank all N securities from highest (rank = N) to lowest (rank = 1), select top X% or top N securities by rank, apply weighting scheme. Weighting schemes include: equal-weight (weight_i = 1/N_selected), market-cap weight (weight_i = market_cap_i / Σmarket_cap), rank-weight (weight_i proportional to rank minus average rank), inverse volatility weight (weight_i = (1/σ_i) / Σ(1/σ_j)), or signal strength weight (weight_i proportional to momentum_score_i).

**Time-series approach** for individual assets: calculate momentum_s = excess_return(t-12, t) for asset s, generate signal_s = sign(momentum_s) where +1 if positive and -1 if negative, scale position by volatility: position_s = signal_s × (target_vol / realized_vol_s), aggregate across assets using equal risk contribution or equal-weight. Volatility estimation uses exponentially weighted moving average with 60-day center of mass: σ²_t = 261 × Σ(1-δ)δ^i × (daily_return_t-i)² where δ ≈ 0.9836.

**Dual momentum combines both**: first apply relative momentum to rank assets and select winner(s), then apply absolute momentum filter: if winner_return > risk_free_rate then invest in winner, else invest in defensive asset. This two-stage process captures both relative performance and trend direction.

**Rebalancing frequency tradeoffs**: daily rebalancing captures short-term trends but incurs highest costs; weekly rebalancing nearly matches daily performance for multi-horizon strategies with far lower costs; monthly rebalancing represents the academic standard and works well for most implementations; quarterly rebalancing substantially reduces turnover with modest performance degradation; annual rebalancing generally too infrequent for momentum strategies. The optimal frequency depends on formation period: shorter formation periods benefit from more frequent rebalancing.

**Risk management overlays** enhance base momentum strategies. Absolute momentum filter: exit position when return falls below zero or T-bill rate, typically saving 30-50% of drawdown during bear markets. Volatility targeting: scale positions inversely to realized volatility to maintain constant risk exposure, reducing position size when volatility spikes. Stop losses: 10-15% trailing stops for ETF strategies, tighter than individual stocks' typical 20% stops. Correlation-based regime detection: increase long exposure and add shorts during trending regimes (high short-term correlation), reduce exposure during mean-reverting regimes (low relative correlation). High-yield spread monitoring: credit market stress indicator, reduce risk when spreads exceed 400bp, exit to bonds above 700bp.

## Performance characteristics and backtesting results

Momentum strategies show consistent performance patterns across implementations. **Cross-sectional stock momentum** (Jegadeesh-Titman): 12% annual returns, 15-20% volatility, 0.45-0.75 Sharpe ratios, -40% to -50% maximum drawdowns in major crises, approximately 170% annual turnover for monthly rebalancing. Negative January seasonality (-6.9% monthly average) but strong positive returns other months (+1.7% average). Returns peak at 12 months then partially reverse over years 2-5.

**Time-series momentum** across 58 futures (Moskowitz-Ooi-Pedersen): 1.10 Sharpe ratio using 12-month signals, 1.79 Sharpe combining 1/3/12-month signals, 19.4% annual returns with 10.8% volatility for combined approach, positive in every decade since 1880, positive during 8 of 10 worst historical crises, low correlation to equity markets (0.09 to MSCI World). By asset class: commodities 1.05 Sharpe, bonds 1.00 Sharpe, currencies 0.87 Sharpe, equities 0.78 Sharpe.

**Dual momentum ETF strategies** show superior risk-adjusted returns. GEM (3-ETF version): 17.4% annual returns, 11.2% volatility, 0.90 Sharpe, -23% maximum drawdown versus -51% for buy-and-hold S&P 500. Four-module dual momentum: 14.9% returns, 8.0% volatility, **1.07 Sharpe, -11% maximum drawdown**, vastly superior to traditional portfolios. SACEMS equal-weight top 3: 10.9% CAGR, 12.8% volatility, 0.85 Sharpe, -20% drawdown versus -36% for buy-and-hold equal-weight.

**Tactical allocation with trend filters** (Faber GTAA): 10.2% returns, 7.0% volatility, 0.70 Sharpe, **-11% maximum drawdown versus -46% for buy-and-hold**, 3-4 total trades per year across 5 assets, robust to parameter variations (3-12 month moving averages all work). Expanded 13-asset version: 11.7% returns, 7.2% volatility, 0.90 Sharpe, -11% drawdown.

**Sector rotation**: 10-12% annual returns, medium volatility, approximately 0.70 Sharpe ratios, -20% to -30% drawdowns, works particularly well in trending markets. Best as tactical overlay rather than core holding.

**Global multi-asset momentum** (Asness-Moskowitz-Pedersen): Individual asset class momentum Sharpes of 0.17-0.74, combined equally across all asset classes reaches 0.74 Sharpe for momentum alone, 50/50 value-momentum combination achieves **1.59 Sharpe with immunity to liquidity risk**, correlation between value and momentum consistently -0.50 to -0.65 providing natural hedge.

Transaction cost impacts vary by strategy. High-turnover stock momentum (170% annually): approximately 1-2% annual drag assuming 50bp round-trip costs for liquid stocks. ETF momentum with monthly rebalancing: less than 1% annual cost impact with commission-free trading and tight spreads. Dual momentum strategies (1-2 trades per year): negligible cost impact below 0.5% annually. Faber TAA (3-4 trades per year total): estimated 20-100bp annual drag. Sector rotation quarterly: approximately 1% annually.

Backtesting methodology consistency across major papers: adjust all prices for dividends and splits, skip most recent month to avoid look-ahead bias in monthly strategies, account for realistic transaction costs (0.5% one-way for stocks, lower for liquid futures/ETFs), exclude non-investable securities (under $1, insufficient liquidity), use point-in-time data (no backfill bias), test across multiple time periods and geographies, conduct robustness tests on parameter variations, report gross and net-of-cost returns, analyze performance across market regimes (bull/bear, high/low volatility, recessions), examine subsample consistency, document maximum drawdowns and recovery periods.

## Practical implementation guidance

Minimum account sizes for implementation vary by complexity. Single ETF strategies (dual momentum GEM): $5,000 minimum as only one position held at a time. 3-5 ETF strategies (SACEMS, simple GTAA): $10,000-15,000 to maintain reasonable position sizes. 9-13 ETF strategies (expanded GTAA, multi-asset): $25,000-50,000 for adequate diversification. Fractional shares where available substantially reduce minimums. Stock-picking momentum: $100,000+ realistically needed for proper diversification and cost management.

Tax efficiency considerations: implement in tax-deferred accounts (IRA, 401k, 403b) whenever possible to avoid annual capital gains. In taxable accounts: dual momentum most efficient (1-2 trades/year, mostly long-term gains), Faber TAA moderately efficient (3-4 trades/year total portfolio), monthly rebalancing strategies less efficient but positions often held 3-6+ months qualifying for long-term treatment, sector rotation quarterly less efficient, high-frequency approaches inappropriate for taxable accounts. Tax-loss harvesting opportunities arise when momentum signals trigger switches at losses.

Platform and tool selection: zero-commission brokers essential (Fidelity, Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Robinhood), support for fractional shares helpful for smaller accounts, API access enables automation, look for portfolio analysis tools. Data sources: Yahoo Finance (free, adequate for monthly strategies), EODHD (premium, comprehensive), broker APIs, Portfolio Visualizer (free backtesting), AllocateSmartly (strategy tracking and analysis), QuantConnect (algorithmic implementation). Screening tools: Quant Investing ETF screener, ETF.com research and data, State Street momentum maps for sectors.

Execution best practices: use market-on-close orders for monthly rebalancing to match backtest methodology, execute all monthly changes simultaneously on last trading day, avoid intraday rebalancing (introduces noise), never adjust positions mid-month based on price movements (violates rules-based discipline), use limit orders only if willing to potentially miss fills, set price alerts rather than constantly monitoring. For weekly strategies, rebalance Friday close using Thursday data. For quarterly, use last trading day of February, May, August, November.

Common implementation mistakes to avoid: over-optimization using excessive parameters or curve-fitting historical data, ignoring transaction costs and slippage, using non-adjusted price data (must include dividend adjustments), insufficient diversification (too few holdings or excessive sector concentration), abandoning strategy during drawdowns (most failures occur from switching at worst times), treating strategies as black boxes without understanding mechanics, neglecting tax consequences in taxable accounts, excessive monitoring leading to discretionary overrides, inadequate backtesting on out-of-sample periods.

Strategy selection by investor profile: **Conservative investors prioritizing capital preservation** should use Faber TAA basic (lowest drawdowns -9% to -11%, bond-like volatility, equity-like returns), SACEMS equal-weight top 3 (good diversification, moderate drawdowns), or modular dual momentum (defensive positioning). **Moderate investors seeking balanced growth** fit well with 12-1 month momentum (3-5 ETFs), SACEMS equal-weight top 2, or sector rotation quarterly. **Aggressive investors maximizing returns** should consider dual momentum GEM (17%+ CAGR, accepted -23% drawdown), SACEMS top 1 (concentrated), CTA proxy with 2:1 leverage, or correlation filter with selective shorting.

**Diversification seekers should combine multiple strategies**: allocate 25% each across dual momentum GEM, Faber TAA, SACEMS top 3, and sector rotation. This reduces strategy-specific risk, smooths returns across different market regimes, and provides multiple uncorrelated momentum approaches. **Low-maintenance investors** benefit most from dual momentum GEM (1-2 trades/year), Faber TAA (3-4 trades/year), or 12-1 month momentum with quarterly rebalancing (4 rebalancing events annually).

## Conclusion and key recommendations

Momentum investing represents one of the most robust, persistent, and implementable market anomalies validated across 30+ years of post-publication academic research. The strategies documented here provide complete specifications enabling immediate implementation across individual stocks, futures, and most practically for retail investors, liquid global ETFs. Cross-sectional momentum captures relative performance by ranking securities, time-series momentum follows absolute trends, and dual momentum combines both for superior risk-adjusted returns with systematic crash protection.

For most investors, **the three highest-priority strategies** balance simplicity, performance, and robustness: (1) Gary Antonacci's dual momentum GEM for highest risk-adjusted returns with minimal complexity—just three ETFs, monthly rebalancing, 1.02 Sharpe ratio with only -18.6% maximum drawdown; (2) Meb Faber's tactical asset allocation for lowest drawdowns and extensive validation—five ETFs, 10-month SMA rule, 40+ years of backtesting, -11% maximum drawdown; (3) SACEMS equal-weight top 3 for moderate risk-return profile with good diversification—nine-ETF universe, 6-month momentum, 0.85 Sharpe with -20% drawdown.

The most important algorithmic patterns consistently appearing across successful implementations: 6-12 month formation periods optimally balance momentum persistence versus reversal, skipping the most recent month avoids short-term noise and microstructure effects, absolute momentum filters (trend-following overlays) reduce maximum drawdowns by 30-70%, volatility scaling maintains consistent risk exposure across changing market conditions, global diversification across asset classes improves Sharpe ratios dramatically, combining value and momentum exploits their -0.60 correlation for 1.5+ Sharpe ratios, monthly or quarterly rebalancing balances responsiveness versus transaction costs.

These strategies work because behavioral biases persist: initial underreaction to information creates price momentum, delayed overreaction extends trends, disposition effects and anchoring slow price adjustment, herding amplifies movements. Risk-based explanations fail to fully explain returns, particularly the powerful value-momentum combination which eliminates liquidity risk exposure while generating the highest risk-adjusted returns documented in empirical finance. The persistence of momentum decades after initial discovery, despite widespread knowledge and trillion-dollar implementations, continues validating these approaches for disciplined, rules-based investors.
