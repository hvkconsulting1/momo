# Executive Summary

**portfolio-momentum** is a modular research and trading framework designed to systematically implement, backtest, and analyze momentum-based investment strategies. Starting with classic cross-sectional equity momentum (Jegadeesh & Titman 1993), the framework provides a robust, extensible architecture that can accommodate time-series momentum (trend-following), dual momentum, and ETF rotation strategies. The primary goal is to create a "momentum lab" rather than a single-strategy system—enabling rigorous research, parameter exploration, and eventual forward-testing with real capital under clearly defined risk controls. The framework serves quantitative traders and researchers who want to move beyond academic papers into practical implementation while maintaining scientific rigor and extensibility for future strategy development.
