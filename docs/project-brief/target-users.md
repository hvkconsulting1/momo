# Target Users

## Primary User Segment: Quantitative Trader/Researcher (Individual)

**Demographic/Profile:**
- Individual with quantitative background (finance, economics, mathematics, computer science, or engineering)
- Comfortable with programming and data analysis
- Has read or is familiar with academic finance literature on momentum strategies
- May be currently employed in tech/finance or pursuing this as a serious side project
- Has access to capital for eventual live trading (even if starting small)

**Current Behaviors & Workflows:**
- Reading academic papers on momentum and factor investing
- Experimenting with backtests using tools like Python/pandas, R, or commercial platforms
- Likely has tried one-off strategy implementations that become hard to maintain or extend
- Spending time on data wrangling and infrastructure instead of strategy research
- May be paper trading or manually tracking ideas without systematic validation

**Specific Needs & Pain Points:**
- **Learning through doing:** Wants to deeply understand momentum strategies by building them from scratch, not just reading about them
- **Systematic experimentation:** Needs to test variants (different lookbacks, universes, weighting schemes) without rewriting everything
- **Confidence to deploy capital:** Requires robust backtesting, paper trading validation, and clear risk controls before committing real money
- **Personal control:** Prefers owning the full stack rather than depending on commercial platforms that may change pricing, features, or shut down
- **Research notebook:** Wants to document what works, what doesn't, and build institutional knowledge over time

**Goals They're Trying to Achieve:**
1. **Deep understanding** of how momentum strategies work across different market regimes
2. **Build a production-ready system** that can go from research idea → validated backtest → paper trading → live trading
3. **Develop an edge** through systematic research and disciplined implementation
4. **Create passive income potential** through evidence-based, risk-controlled trading strategies
5. **Compound learning** where each new strategy builds on proven infrastructure and accumulated knowledge
