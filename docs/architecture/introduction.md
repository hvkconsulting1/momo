# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for portfolio-momentum (momo), a quantitative momentum research framework. It serves as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This project does not include a frontend user interface. The primary interface is Jupyter notebooks for interactive research. No separate Frontend Architecture Document is required.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** Greenfield project - no starter template

This is a new quantitative research framework being built from scratch. The PRD explicitly states this is a personal research tool with a custom-built backtest engine (not using external frameworks like zipline or backtrader). The specialized nature of this project (momentum strategy research with Norgate Data integration) doesn't align well with existing boilerplate projects.
