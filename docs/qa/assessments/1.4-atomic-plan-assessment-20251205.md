### Dependency Pre-Check

**Prerequisite Stories**:
- Story 1.2: Windows Python Bridge (`src/momo/data/bridge.py`)
- Story 1.3: Data Cache & Loader (`src/momo/data/cache.py`, `src/momo/data/loader.py`)

**Dependencies Met**: ✅

**Check Results**:
- ✅ Story 1.2 bridge.py exists and has `execute_norgate_code()` function
- ✅ Story 1.3 cache.py exists and has cache management functions
- ✅ Story 1.3 loader.py exists and has `load_universe()` function
- ✅ Python version requirement met: 3.13.7 (requires >=3.13 per pyproject.toml)
- ✅ External tool dependencies: NDU for Norgate documented (integration tests have skip conditions)
- ✅ Base exception classes exist: `DataError`, `BridgeError` defined in exceptions.py

**Issues**: None - ✅

---

### Test Data Feasibility

**Total Fixtures Required**: 15 (from test design conftest.py)

**Fixture Breakdown**:
- **Synthetic Fixtures**: 13 (87%)
  - `sample_price_df_clean` - Generated DataFrame (5 tickers, 10 days)
  - `sample_price_df_with_nans_close` - Synthetic NaN injection
  - `sample_price_df_with_nans_ohlc` - Synthetic NaN injection
  - `sample_price_df_with_10day_gap` - Date gap generation
  - `sample_price_df_with_weekends_missing` - Normal weekday-only data
  - `sample_price_df_with_july4_missing` - Known holiday (July 4, 2020)
  - `sample_price_df_with_negative_price` - Synthetic invalid data
  - `sample_price_df_with_50pct_jump_no_div` - Synthetic adjustment issue
  - `sample_price_df_with_aapl_split` - Historical split data (can be synthetic)
  - `sample_price_df_with_enron_delisted` - Historical delisting (can be synthetic)
  - `sample_price_df_with_recent_delisting` - Synthetic recent delisting
  - `sample_price_df_100tickers` - Large synthetic dataset for performance
  - `mock_bridge_response_russell1000` - Mock list of 1000 tickers

- **Cached Data Fixtures**: 1 (7%)
  - `cached_corrupt_test_data` - Pre-generated test data (can use synthetic generation)

- **Historical Data Fixtures**: 1 (7%)
  - Apple 7:1 split (June 2014) - Can use synthetic approximation

**Feasibility Assessment**: PASS ✅

**Analysis**:
- 87% of fixtures are synthetic - easily generated using pandas DataFrame construction
- No fixtures require live API calls in unit tests (all mocked)
- Integration test 1.4-INT-001 requires NDU but has skip condition documented
- Historical data fixtures (Apple split, Enron delisting) can be approximated synthetically with realistic dates
- Large dataset fixture (100 tickers) is feasible to generate programmatically
- Total fixture generation estimated at < 500 LOC

**Issues**: None - all fixtures are feasible and well-scoped ✅

---

### Type System Compatibility

**Complex Types Identified**:
```python
ValidationReport:
  - date_range: tuple[datetime.date, datetime.date]
  - missing_data_counts: dict[str, int]
  - date_gaps: dict[str, list[tuple[datetime.date, datetime.date]]]
  - delisting_events: dict[str, datetime.date | None]
```

**Python Version**: 3.13.7 (fully supports PEP 604 union syntax with `|`)
**Mypy Strict Mode**: Enabled (per pyproject.toml and CLAUDE.md)

**Compatibility**: ✅ PASS

**Analysis**:
- Python 3.13 fully supports modern type syntax (union with `|`, PEP 585 generics)
- Nested dict types are standard and well-supported by mypy
- `datetime.date` vs `date` import handled via explicit imports
- Story documentation recommends `from datetime import date as Date` pattern for clarity
- Type hints in test design are consistent with project standards

**Issues**: None - type system is compatible ✅

---

### Test Execution Budget

**Estimated Unit Test Runtime**: ~2 seconds (16 tests with mocked I/O)
**Estimated Integration Test Runtime**: ~70 seconds (1 real bridge call ~60s, 3 other tests ~10s)
**Estimated Total Runtime**: ~72 seconds
**CI Timeout Limit**: 120 seconds (typical default) to 600 seconds (max)

**Within Budget**: ✅

**Long-Running Tests** (> 5s):
- 1.4-INT-001: Fetch Russell 1000 constituents via bridge (~60s, documented with skip condition if NDU unavailable)

**Analysis**:
- Unit tests are fast (< 2s total) with mocked I/O
- Integration test 1.4-INT-001 is documented as long-running (< 60s timeout specified in test design)
- Integration test 1.4-INT-003 validates performance < 5s (within budget)
- Total test suite runtime (~72s) well within CI timeout limits
- NDU-dependent tests have skip conditions for CI environments without NDU

**Issues**: None - test execution budget is reasonable ✅

---

### Commit Size Validation

**Total Commits**: 8
**Largest Commit**: Commit 7 (5 tests + delisting detection + report formatting)
**Estimated Max Commit Size**: ~300 LOC (within < 500 LOC guideline)

**Size Breakdown (Estimated)**:
- Commit 1: ~50 LOC (exception class + 1 test)
- Commit 2: ~200 LOC (dataclass + skeleton function + 3 tests + fixtures)
- Commit 3: ~150 LOC (missing data detection + 3 tests + fixtures)
- Commit 4: ~150 LOC (date gap detection + 3 tests + fixtures)
- Commit 5: ~150 LOC (adjustment checks + 3 tests + fixtures)
- Commit 6: ~200 LOC (constituent retrieval + 4 tests + bridge helper + fixtures)
- Commit 7: ~300 LOC (delisting detection + report formatting + 5 tests + fixtures) ⚠️
- Commit 8: ~150 LOC (3 integration tests + fixtures)

**Atomicity**: ✅ PASS

**Analysis**:
- All commits are atomic (single logical feature with complete test coverage)
- Largest commit (Commit 7) estimated at ~300 LOC - still within 500 LOC guideline
- Commit 7 combines delisting detection + report formatting - related functionality, acceptable grouping
- No commit combines multiple unrelated features
- Commit dependencies are minimal (mostly linear: 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8)
- Commits 3-7 are independent after Commit 2 (can be parallelized if needed)

**Issues**: ⚠️ WARNING - Commit 7 is the largest (~300 LOC). Consider monitoring during implementation; if it grows beyond 400 LOC, consider splitting delisting detection (1.4-UNIT-017, 018) from report formatting (1.4-UNIT-019, 020, 021).

**Legend**:
- ✅ Fully covered (tests + commits + risk mitigation)

**Assessment**: ✅ Perfect traceability - every AC has full coverage across tests, risks, and commits.

---

## Readiness Assessment

### Blockers (Must Fix Before Implementation) ❌

**None - ✅**

All critical requirements are met:
- ✅ All 4 planning artifacts present and complete
- ✅ All 8 acceptance criteria covered by tests and commits
- ✅ Both critical risks (DATA-001, TECH-001) have comprehensive P0 test coverage
- ✅ All tests from test design assigned to commits
- ✅ Prerequisite stories (1.2, 1.3) are merged and dependencies exist
- ✅ Required base classes (`DataError`, `BridgeError`) exist in exceptions.py
- ✅ Test execution budget is within limits

**Impact**: Ready to proceed with Commit 1 immediately.

---

### Warnings (Should Address Before Implementation) ⚠️

1. **⚠️ Commit 7 Size**: Estimated at ~300 LOC (largest commit)
   - **Impact**: May approach 500 LOC limit if implementation is more complex than estimated
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor during implementation. If exceeding 400 LOC, consider splitting:
     - Commit 7a: Delisting detection (1.4-UNIT-017, 018)
     - Commit 7b: Report formatting (1.4-UNIT-019, 020, 021)
   - **Severity**: Low - still within guideline, just largest commit

2. **⚠️ Integration Test NDU Dependency**: Test 1.4-INT-001 requires NDU running
   - **Impact**: Integration test may be skipped in CI environments without NDU access
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure skip condition is properly implemented: `@pytest.mark.skipif(not ndu_available(), reason="NDU not running")`
   - **Mitigation**: Already documented in test design with skip conditions
   - **Severity**: Low - documented and mitigated

3. **⚠️ Historical Data Fixtures**: Apple split and Enron delisting fixtures require realistic dates
   - **Impact**: Test fixtures may need careful construction to avoid false positives/negatives
   - **Recommendation**: Use synthetic data with documented realistic dates rather than fetching real historical data
   - **Mitigation**: Test design already recommends synthetic approximations
   - **Severity**: Low - feasible with synthetic data

**Overall Impact**: Warnings do not block implementation. They are minor considerations for execution phase.

---

### Recommendations 💡

1. **Test Execution Order**: Follow recommended order from test design (P0 unit → P1 unit → P0 integration → P1/P2)
   - Fast-fail strategy maximizes feedback speed
   - Critical path tests (P0) validate core functionality first

2. **Commit 7 Monitoring**: During Commit 7 implementation, if LOC count approaches 400, consider split:
   - Commit 7a: Delisting detection (AC5: tests 017, 018)
   - Commit 7b: Report formatting & docs (AC6, AC8: tests 019, 020, 021)

3. **Bridge Helper Function**: If constituent retrieval requires new bridge helper, add to `bridge.py` in Commit 6
   - Follow existing `fetch_price_data()` pattern
   - Use 60s timeout (vs 30s for price data) as documented in risk profile

4. **Fixture Organization**: Create fixtures incrementally commit-by-commit (don't front-load all 15 fixtures in Commit 2)
   - Commit 2: Core fixtures (clean data)
   - Commits 3-7: Add fixtures as needed per commit
   - Commit 8: Add large fixtures for integration tests

5. **Performance Baseline**: In integration test 1.4-INT-003, log actual execution time for 100-ticker validation
   - Establishes baseline for future performance monitoring
   - Target: < 5s (documented in test design)

6. **Documentation First**: Ensure module docstring with usage example is written in Commit 2 (caught by test 1.4-UNIT-021 in Commit 7)
   - Prevents test failure in later commit
   - Aligns with documentation-first development

- ✅ Total commit count reasonable (8 commits, within 5-15 range)
- ✅ Each commit has verification commands (pytest + mypy)
- ✅ Each commit has: title, test IDs, ACs, priority
- ✅ Each commit has setup instructions
- ✅ Commit dependencies documented (linear: 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8)
- ✅ Execution order summary present
- ✅ Conventional commit format in titles (build:, feat:, test:)

### Implementation Readiness Checklist

**Dependency Pre-Check:**
- ✅ Prerequisite stories merged (Story 1.2 bridge, Story 1.3 cache/loader)
- ✅ Required base classes/modules exist (DataError, BridgeError in exceptions.py)
- ✅ Python version requirement met (3.13.7, requires >=3.13)
- ✅ External tool dependencies documented (NDU with skip conditions)

**Test Data Feasibility:**
- ✅ All fixtures are synthetic or cached (87% synthetic, 13% cached/historical)
- ✅ No fixtures require live API calls in unit tests (all mocked)
- ✅ Historical data fixtures have clear provenance (Apple split, Enron delisting documented)
- ✅ Large dataset fixtures can be generated/cached (100-ticker fixture feasible)

**Type System Compatibility:**
- ✅ Complex nested types compatible with Python version (3.13 supports all features)
- ✅ Forward reference strategy documented if needed (use `from __future__ import annotations`)
- ✅ Mypy strict mode compatibility verified (types follow project standards)

**Test Execution Budget:**
- ✅ Estimated runtime within CI timeout (72s < 120s minimum timeout)
- ✅ Long-running tests (> 5s) identified (1.4-INT-001: 60s with skip condition)
- ✅ NDU-dependent tests have skip conditions (documented in test design)

**Commit Size Validation:**
- ⚠️ All commits estimated < 500 LOC (largest: Commit 7 at ~300 LOC - within guideline)
- ✅ Largest commit identified (Commit 7: delisting + formatting)
- ✅ No commits combine unrelated features (all atomic)
- ✅ Commit dependencies are minimal (linear sequence)
