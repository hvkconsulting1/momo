# Type Ignore Registry

This document tracks all `type: ignore` comments in the codebase with justification and removal plans.

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-04

**Purpose:** Every `type: ignore` comment represents a type safety gap. This registry ensures each one is justified, tracked, and has a plan for resolution or permanent acceptance.

**Policy:**
- All `type: ignore` comments must be registered here
- Each entry must have a justification
- Each entry must have a removal plan or permanent acceptance reason
- Entries should be resolved or permanently accepted within 2-3 stories
